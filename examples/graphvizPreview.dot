//1. install graphviz preview
//then access the menu with up arrow + command (mac) + p
//then type ">" and click the one that says graphviz.showPreviewToSide

//common words: node, edge, graph, digraph, subgraph, strict

//Examples of things you can do:
//label = "name you want to give it"
//fontname = "any font"
//shape = shape of node; box, ellipse, record, invtriangle, diamond
//fontsize = "16"
//style=filled
//color=green
//subgraph makes a section of the graph its own thing
//A -> {B C} is the same as A -> B and A -> C together

//extra; not sure what these do
//graph[page="8.5,11",size="7.5,7",ratio=fill,center=1];
